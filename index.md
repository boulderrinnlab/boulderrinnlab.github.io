## Welcome to the Rinn lab git hub.



Our laboratory aims to bridge the computational and experimental sciences to explore the human genome for new types of regulatory elements.
Here we share our [laboratory protocols](https://github.com/boulderrinnlab/Protocols), [code](https://github.com/boulderrinnlab/PerilPaperAnalysis), [teaching](https://github.com/boulderrinnlab/CLASS_2021) and [publication summaries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRij100Kgla9Q4t3kEd0YLA)
